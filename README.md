# Gary Simons - personal resume website



## Overview


This is a website to **promote me as a full stack web developer**. In the future, I shall be able to use it to send to potential employers as a way of **advertising my skills.** It has been built using **template inheritance** which will make it easier to add content as my projects and skills grow. 

The aim of the project is to produce a website using **Flask** and **Python** that allows the use of data stored in a database on **MongoDB**. The website has to demonstrate the data storage principles that you should be able to **create, read, update and delete (CRUD)** that data through a user interface. For my project, the **user** of that interface will be **me** as the website's owner. 

The site is hosted on **Heroku** as part of the project requirements.

## Design choices

**The website is designed to reflect me as a creative full stack web developer** and show my style. The website is clean and stylish, using muted blocks of colour to define areas. 

### Colours
I created a **simple, complimentary, sophisticated colour scheme** that carries through the site. This enables the different pages to have their own feel and identity, while maintaining a holding colour theme that ties them all together, giving an upmarket feel.
* ```dark-grey: #4d4d4d```
* ```light-grey: #a6a6a6```
* ```dark-pink: #a34966```
* ```light-pink: #d996a9```
* ```dark-green: #5c9990```
* ```light-green: #bacfb2```
* ```dark-blue: #3c5682```
* ```light-blue: #688499```

### Fonts
I've used the sans serif font [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) in two weights, (300 and 500) with some **sophisticated letter spacing** to add to the airy feel. I like the no-nonsense clean lines of the font, and feel it suits the website perfectly.

### Grid
I carried the **same basic grid through** the pages to add consistency and easy of navigation. A large **section header** quickly establishes the page you've landed on, and under that, is a panel holding the content for that page. A footer on each page hold **social media links and a downloadable CV.**

### Illustration
I created an image of a **woodcut style bird** carrying a card with the coding symbol **</>** on it. It is not only a beautiful image, but symbolizes me delivering coding solutions. I have used this image throughout the website and a visual logo of the website and of me.

---

## Wireframes

I built my wireframes using **Balsamiq Wireframes**. This was a quick and easy way to work out the basic pages and element and how the would interact with each other. I then mocked up more detailed versions using **Adobe InDesign** to allow me to play with fonts, colours and images. The basic structure from my wireframes remained much the same, but colours, styling and some elements were adapted as I built the website and saw how it worked as a whole.

## Features

### Navigation bar
**This holds all the links to the sections of the site:** Logo (home button), home, about, projects and contact. This allows the user to navigate quickly to the relevant section. The **navigation bar** is always visible when you are on the site, allowing for easy navigation to any part, no matter where you first land. The **home button and logo** will take you right back to the **home page** where you can get your bearings and start your journey.

### Home
This is the first page a user comes to and it has to make a big impact. It has the job of informing the user as to what sort of site this is and to entice them to move further and engage with it. It opens with **strong simple white typography** on a plain grey background. Having a big name announces very quickly who the website is about. The tag line underneath then gives more context and explains what they do. **A beautiful illustration of a bird holding a card with </> on it symbolizes delivering code.** A tasteful **about me** link invites them to enter the website and takes the user straight to the **about page** where they can learn more.

### About
The about page shows some of the **key information about me.** There is a brief introduction to me and the things I stand for. Below that are two panels. One showing **my skills** with an easy to understand progress bar showing my proficiency level in a graphic way. The other shows my **relevant education and qualifications.** All pages apart from the home page have a **footer**, which holds links to my **LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram** and a **downloadable pdf of my CV.** It has a **copyright** sign off displaying the current year.  

### Projects
The projects page highlights some of the **work I have been doing.** Each project is in a coloured panel with the website showing in a graphic line drawing of a laptop. A **view button** under each title opens a **large modal** with larger images of a laptop, tablet and phone. There is a short description of the website, a list of programs and languages used and a link to the **live website.** This gives the user an insight into the thinking behind the website and the way it was built. They can see how it displays on different devices, and then link to the website to see for themselves. I used the two websites that I have built as **Milestone Projects** and made two **fake website homepages** to show how it would work with more.

### Contact
The contact page simply holds a **form for users to fill in and contact me.** I kept the wording on the page very **inviting and conversational** to help the user feel more at ease and give a **friendly vibe.** 

### Favicon
The website has a **Favicon** to visually show the user where the site is in their open tabs. It uses the **GS** logo from the navigation bar on the same grey background to tie it together.

---

## Features left to implement

* If time allowed I would have liked to add to the admin page, to enable me to **build more projects.** I would build a template that would allow me to quickly and simply add as many as needed.
* It would be good to add a **blog page.** This would give another insight into my interests, skills and personality, and allow the users to be more engaged with me as a person.
* I would like to **wire up the contact form** to send messages to my email.

## Testing
* This was first time using **Python, Flask and MongoDB.** My testing was very thorough as each piece of code and app route had to work and link to the relevant part of the website. 
* Being very conscious of how easy it was for these elements to fail. I **tested constantly** to make sure they performed how I wanted them to, each time I added or made a change to my code.
* The testing involved myself and that of my friends and family.

### Planning
The planning for this project involved using my **wireframes** to sketch a plan of which pages, buttons and forms needed to link to the database and to other parts. 

### Stories

* After deciding on a palette of colours for the website. It was felt I had **too many** and need to edit them down. I played around using a **Hex Colour Picker** website to find the colours that worked together as a family. Enough difference that they had their own identity, but similar enough to connect. I chose **four basic colours** and used a dark version and a light version.

* On my mock ups and during most of the build, I had my **social links** as just letters **'Li'** (LinkedIn), **'Tw'** (Twitter) etc. I felt they added a very stylish 'designer' look to the pages. But after several testers found them confusing and didn't immediately get what they were, I changed them to **FontAwesome** icons to make it clearer. I liked my letters, but the world wasn't ready for them.

* From my wireframes right up until near the end I had a **button to take you to the admin page.** First it was in the **navigation bar**, but I felt I didn't want users to click on it, so I put it small on the contact page at the bottom in the **footer**. I was still a bit worried about it being still quite public, so my mentor suggested **not having the button at all.** Instead the admin page is accessed by adding **'/admin' to the url.** This makes it more **secure.** It also allowed me to add the footer to each page.

### Overall

#### Responsiveness
* I wanted my website to be fully responsive and work and look perfect on all devices. 
* I used **Bootstrap** to build the basic grid of my website. This involved selection the best breakpoints to find the perfect balance on all devices. Testing the changes using the **Chrome Developer Tools** tools to get it right.
* The result was a very balanced and dynamic website that looked slick and stylish when adapting to different devices.

#### Design
* The design of the website needed to be clean, stylish and sophisticated. I had most of the elements and feel of the pages all worked out at the **wireframe** stage. Using the simple clean sans serif font [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) in two weights, (300 and 500), and **opening up the letter spacing**, allowed me to create that feel. The **muted colours** all work together as a family to hold it together. 
* Using **CSS** styling allowed to create styles for images, words and panels that could be **replicated** across the website. This also meant that it was easy to **change multiple elements quickly and simply.**
* The result is a website that has an elegant, upmarket design to allow users to see my creative side.

#### Projects page
* The projects page needed a way to showcase my work to the user. Originally I simply had each project in a panel with an image of the homepage on a laptop with some text underneath describing the website and a link to the live version. However. it was felt that this wasn't very dynamic. 
* To solve this, I created a **large modal** that pops up when the view button is clicked.
* This was a better solution as it allowed me to create a graphic showing the home page on laptop, tablet and mobile. It gave me more room to write the description and add the link to the live website.
* It is also better for **user experience** as it adds more interest and drama when it pops up. It also leaves the projects page cleaner and neater.

### Bugs

#### Hamburger menu on mobile
* I am using the **Bootstrap hamburger menu** on the mobile version of my website. This has been working will and I was happy with how it looked.
* Towards the end of the build, I updated my jQuery script from **3.4.1** to **3.5.0** as it was discovered to be out of date. Just after while carrying out some testing on my phone, I discovered that my hamburger menu was no longer firing. 
* After looking for a solution and coming up blank, it was looked into by a **tutor** who did some investigating and found that the update was clashing with the navigation bar.
* I therefore reverted back to **3.4.1** and the hamburger menu worked again.

#### Template Inheritance
* When first trying to work with Template Inheritance I built a **base.html** page with a code block to hold the html from the other pages. But when I ran my app.py file, I was getting an error telling that it couldn't find my template. 
* On investigation I discovered that my folder structure was wrong, so none of the files could be found.
* I restructured by folders and put the files in their right pages, and was able to get the html pages to load inside the block code.

#### Heroku app
* Having linked my Heroku app to update every time I pushed to my repository. I was happy that all would be fine. It was deploying to Heroku and looked good. 
* However, my app just kept giving me an error when I tried to launch it.
* It was discovered that the problem was that I had set up an **env.py** file, that was being hidden in a **.gitignore file** to keep my password safe. This information wasn't being uploaded to Heroku, so it couldn't work.
* I therefore had to set the value for the this in the **Config Vars** of Heroku. Once there, Heroku could read it and the app worked.

#### Footer
* Viewed on a large screen and manually changing the screen size the footer appeared to work well and stay at the bottom of the page.
* However, when checking the page via inspect, I found it didn't go to the bottom of the screen on a tablet when there wasn't enough content on the page to push it down.
* I fixed this problem using flexbox in my css to make it always go to the bottom of the page.

## Deployment

**My site is deployed on Heroku and GitHub.**

I've been using **GitPod**. These are the steps that I used in a **Unique Linux environment**. Please make sure you read your documentation to comply with your operating system.

1. First log onto **Heroku**.
2. In the **App Name form**, create a unique app name.
3. In the **Choose a Region** drop-down, choose **Europe** as that's our region and delivery will be quicker.
4. Click on **Create App**.
5. Next, log in to Heroku in the terminal with ```heroku login```. You will need to enter you email and password. This allows the connection from your project to Heroku and allows us to push changes to Heroku using git.
6. Create a new Git repository with the command, ```git init```.
7. Do a ```git add .``` to add the files and ```git commit -m "Intial commit"``` to commit those files.
8. We need now to associate Heroku as our remote master branch. Back on Heroku you will find the command ```heroku git:remote -a (name of your app)```, in the Deploy using Heroku Git section. Paste this into the terminal to set it up.
9. Create a **requirements.txt** file which will contain a list of all the applications required for Heroku to run the application.To do this type ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt``` in the terminal. This will create a txt file with the list in.
10. Add this file, commit it and push it to Heroku with ```git push heroku master```.
11. You now have to create a **Procfile** which will tell Heroku which file to call to get the application running. To do this, in the terminal write ```echo web: python app.py > Procfile```. Add this to GitHub, and commit. Then ```git push heroku master``` to save it to Heroku.
12. Next, we want to get our application running on Heroku. In the terminal, type ```heroku ps:scale web=1```. 
13. On Heroku, go to **'settings'**, and click on the **'Reveal Config Vars'** button. 
14. In here we need to supply a our IP address and our port. The first key is **'IP'** and it's value is **'0.0.0.0'**. The second key is **'PORT'** and it's value is **'5000'**. If you have hidden sensitive data such as your **MONGO_URI** in your **env.py** file, you must also put in the key of **MONGO_URI**, and the value of the **password code** from the env.py file. This is so Heroku can see it.
15. Click on the button **'Open app'** and it will start the app and show your page.
16. To make sure you push to Heroku automatically each time you push to GitHub, you can set it up in Heroku.
17. First click on **Deploy**, and click on **Deployment Method**. Then click on the **GitHub** selection.
18. Below that in click on **Connect to GitHub**, and enter your repository's name, and search for it. **Connect**.
19. Click on **Enable Automatic Deploys**, underneath that.
20. Finally, deploy it by clicking the **Deploy Branch** button.
21. Now every time you push to GitHub, it will automatically push it through to Heroku too.

### Deploy locally

**In order to deploy this project locally you must do a number of things.**

1. First in the GitHub repository, click on the **Clone or download** button on the repository.
2. Click on the **Open in Desktop** button.
3. Click the **Choose** button and navigate to a local path where you want to clone the repository.
4. Click the **Clone** button.
5. You will need to make sure you have **Python 3.7** installed.
6. You will need to type ```pip3 install requirements.txt``` in your terminal.
7. Create an ```env.py``` file.
8. Inside this file you will need to provide some information for this app to run. ```import os```
```os.environ["MONGO_URI"] = 'mongodb+srv://Name:<password>@collection-2pvma.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority'```

## Closing notes

* I've really enjoyed building this website has taught me lots of interesting new ways to do it. I really like using the **template inheritance** where you build a skeleton document, then **block codes** to allow you to place elements on pages. This seems to me to be a brilliant way to simplify and reduce the amount to code that has to be written. It also would prevent errors where you might change one page, but forget another.
* I've also found the **database** element of the challenge to be very interesting and fun. I like how you can control the data on one page the website and it updates it on another.
